Postdoctoral research scholar at the DOE Joint Genome Institute.

I like to study microbial ecology and genomics mainly through **bioinformatics**.

I am currently looking for previously uncharacterized lineages of protists using molecular phylogenetics, genomics, and metagenomics. My aim is to eventually understand the phylogenetic and metabolic diversity that these novel taxa harbor and how they have been shaped by the environment.

Previous research aimed to reclaim the uncharacterized protein content of metagenomic data in order to infer functional information.

I have also worked on a mine tailing bioremediation project analyzing microbiome and RNASeq data to understand the establishment of pioneer plants in this toxic substrate.
