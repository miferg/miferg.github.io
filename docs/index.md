I like to study microbial ecology and genomics mainly through **bioinformatics**.

My research interests include the study of ecology and evolution of microorganisms using genomic and metagenomic tools, including prokaryotic, eukaryotic and viral organisms. Similarly, I am passionate about software development through designing and implementing specialized software for genomic and metagenomic data analysis. I am also interested in teaching and mentoring students.

I am currently analyzing the diversity and distribution of soil fauna and protists from many different soil sources from Mexico. Previous research focused on looking for previously uncharacterized lineages of protists using molecular phylogenetics, genomics, and metagenomics. Recently I have recently started working on genomics of giant viruses. My Ph.D work aimed to reclaim the uncharacterized protein content of metagenomic data in order to infer functional information. I have also studied mine tailing bioremediation by analyzing both microbiome composition and gene expression (RNA-Seq) data to understand the mechanisms enabling pioneer plants to colonize these toxic environments.
